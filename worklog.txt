Frodau 16 Oct 2009
in 1100 meeting with KP.
out 1200 1h

Sunday 18 Oct 2009
in 1557 Thinking about minimize from the lattice POV, investigating a poset library.  Noticed our pairwise-comparison method only finds local minimums.
out 1848 2h51m

Wednesday 21 Oct 2009
in 1800 Thinking about KP's non-gradient algorithm for minimize.  (Is it actually non-gradient?)
1838 Writing intersect, synchronize. 
out 1942 1h42m; week so far: 4h93m=5h33m

Th 22 Oct 2009
in 1530 Synchronize.
1702 Thinking about the rough complexity notes KP sent.
out 1737 2h7m; week so far: 6h40m
in 1812 Thinking about all the pieces of the algorithm.  (Like, seeing if we can get away with homonyms without explicit indexes...   since we do change the indexes when we do minimize.)
out 1920 1h8m; so far 8h48m
in 1941
out 2007 26m; so far 9h14m
in 2202 writing comments on KP's complexity-analysis notes.
out 2242 40m

Week: 9h54m

Friday 23 Oct 2009
in 1100 meeting with KP: talking about analysis, worked out why T1<<T2<<T3 in complexity.  Figured out how many steps it takes to compute transitive closure.
out 1320 2h20m

Sunday 25 Oct 2009
in 1750 thinking about why simple ways to avoid calculating transitive closure don't stop us from requiring more steps than Type 1 (which has no blocking rules).
out 1847 57m; so far 3h17m

Friday 31 Oct 2009
~1h meeting (really it was longer, but we talked about me as well, so I won't charge for more than an hour).

Thursday 5 Nov 2009
in 1756 Writing the Intersect function.
out 1810 14m

Sunday 8 Nov 2009
in 1921 Resuming.
2005 Responding to complexity notes.  Working out some analysis stuff (like whether we can just multiply max steps*max work per step -- not obvious that it's okay to do that).
out 2353 4h32m

Tuesday 9 Nov 2009
in 1824
1824 Resuming complexity stuff.  Writing an e-mail arguing that we can still make the right predictions if we ignore complexity.
out 2004 1h40m
in 2220 Resuming.
out 2355 1h35m; today 2h75m=3h15m; so far 7h47m

Wednesday 10 Nov 2009
in 1850 Programming.
out 1950 1h; so far 8h47m

Th 11 nov 2009
in 2046 Programming/testing.
out 2324 2h22m

Week: 10h69m=11h9m

Fr 12 nov 2009
in 1100 KP meeting.
out 1200 1h



----- Total hours until now:
	1h+2h+1h+2h+1h+2h+1h+4h+1h+1h+2h+1h + 51m+42m+7m+8m+26m+40m+20m+57m+14m+32m+35m+22m
=	19h + 354m
